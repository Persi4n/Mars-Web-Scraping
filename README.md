# Mars Web Scraping and Data Analysis Project

## Overview

This project involves web scraping data related to Mars from various sources, performing data analysis on the scraped data, and visualizing the findings. It consists of two main deliverables:

1. **Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News**
   - Use automated browsing with Splinter to visit a Mars news website.
   - Utilize Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing and data extraction.
   - Store titles and preview text of news articles in Python data structures.
   - Export the scraped data to a JSON file (optional).

2. **Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data**
   - Automate browsing to visit a Mars temperature data site.
   - Extract data from an HTML table using Beautiful Soup.
   - Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame.
   - Analyze the dataset to answer questions about Martian weather.
   - Visualize the data using matplotlib.

## Project Structure

The project consists of two Jupyter Notebooks:

1. `part_1_mars_news.ipynb`: This notebook focuses on scraping titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

2. `part_2_mars_weather.ipynb`: This notebook involves scraping and analyzing Mars weather data.

## Dependencies

This project relies on the following Python libraries and tools:

- Splinter: For automated web browsing.
- Beautiful Soup: For HTML parsing and data extraction.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Matplotlib: For data visualization.
- Jupyter Notebook: For creating and running Python notebooks.

Make sure to install these dependencies using pip or your preferred package manager before running the notebooks.

## Instructions

To replicate and explore this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Open and run the Jupyter Notebooks in the following order:
   - `part_1_mars_news.ipynb`
   - `part_2_mars_weather.ipynb`
4. Follow the code and instructions within each notebook to scrape and analyze the Mars data.
5. Visualize the results and observe the findings.

## Results

The project will provide insights into Mars news articles and weather data, including average temperatures by month, atmospheric pressure trends, and the number of Earth days in a Martian year.
